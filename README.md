Just Served! is a second year student project. It is a prototype made in one month. It is not finished.  I don't know the future of this concept, maybe I'll add more levels and a possibility to play up to 2 players. We will see ! 

For now,  you can test the level I used as a prototype. But be aware that it may contain bugs or unwanted behaviours... 

I hope you will have fun to play it !
